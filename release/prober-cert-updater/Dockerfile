# This Dockerfile renews the SSL certs used by the probers. It uses the builder
# image, and should be built after the builder in the release process. It also
# needs the :core:nomulus jar in this directory, which is the caller's
# responsibility to copy it here.

# Although any Linux-based Java image with bash would work (e.g., openjdk:11),
# as a GCP application we prefer to start with a GCP-approved base image.

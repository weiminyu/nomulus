# Set up connection to the Cloud SQL instance.
# For now we use Cloud SQL Proxy to set up a SSL tunnel to the Cloud SQL
# instance. This has two drawbacks:
# - It starts a background process, which is an anti-pattern in Docker.
# - The main job needs to wait for a while for the proxy to come up.
# We will research for a better long-term solution.
#
# Other options considered:
# - Connect using Socket Factory in this script.
#   * Drawback: need to manage version and transitive dependencies
#     of the postgres-socket-factory jar.
# - Create a self-contained Java application that connects using socket factory
#   * Drawback: Seems an overkill

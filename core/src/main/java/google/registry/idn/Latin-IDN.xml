    <h1>Label Generation Rules for the Latin Script</h1>

    <h2>Overview</h2>

    <p>This document specifies a set of Label Generation Rules (LGR) for the Latin script for the second level domain or domains identified above. 
    The starting point for the development of this LGR can be found in the related Root Zone LGR [RZ-LGR-Latn]. 
    The format of this file follows [RFC 7940].
    This LGR is adapted from the “Reference LGR for the Second Level for the Latin Script” [Ref-LGR-und-Latn], for details, see <a href="#change_history">Change History</a> below.</p>

    <p>For details and additional background on the Latin script, see “Proposal for a Latin Script Root Zone Label Generation Rule-Set (LGR)” [Proposal-Latin].</p>

    <h2>Repertoire</h2>

    <p>The repertoire contains the 164 letters needed to write hundreds of languages in the Latin script.
     The repertoire is a subset of [Unicode 11.0.0]. For details, see Section 5, “Repertoire” in [Proposal-Latin].
        (The proposal cited has been adopted for the Latin script portion of the Root Zone LGR.)</p>

    <p>For the second level, the repertoire has been augmented with the ASCII digits, U+0030 to U+0039, plus U+002D HYPHEN-MINUS, for a total of 175 repertoire elements.</p>

    <p>Any code points outside the Latin Script repertoire that are targets for
     out-of-repertoire variants would be included here only if the variant is listed 
     in this file. In this case they are identified as a reflexive (identity) variant
     of type “out-of-repertoire-var”. Whether or not they are listed, they do not 
     form part of the repertoire.</p>
    
    <p><b>Repertoire Listing:</b> Each code point or range is tagged with the script or scripts with which the code point is used and one or more other character categories. For each repertoire element,
      one or more references document sufficient justification for inclusion in the repertoire; see the <a href="#ref_desc_sec_References">“References”</a> below.
    For code points that are part of the repertoire, comments identify the languages using the code point along with their [EGIDS] level.</p>

    <h3>Background on Script and Principal Languages Using It</h3>
    <p>The Latin script is a major writing system of the world, and the most widely used in terms of 
    the number of languages and speakers, with circa 70% of the world’s readers and writers making use of 
    this script. From a list of 1,189 languages using the Latin script [Omniglot]
    the 212 languages   that were taken into consideration contain all 182 languages with [EGIDS] 
    level 1&ndash;4 together with many languages with EGIDS level 5, each spoken by more than 
    1 million estimated speakers. Altogether over 100 languages are cited here to justify 
    specific additions to the repertoire, but many other languages may also be written using 
    some subset of the repertoire of this LGR. In a few cases, code points were excluded in [MSR-5] due to 
    security concerns; for the affected languages, only a subrepertoire could be supported.
    More details in Section 3, “Background on Script and Principal Languages Using It” 
    of [Proposal-Latin].</p>

    <h2>Variants</h2>

    <p>The variants defined in this LGR are limited to those required for use in zones not shared with any other script. 
    As such, this LGR does not define cross-script variants. However, using this LGR concurrently with any LGR for Armenian, Cyrillic, and Greek in the same zone will introduce some in-script variants due to cross-script variant transitivity. This will also create potential cross-script issues when used with the same LGRs. 
    For details, see Section 6, “Variants” in [Proposal-Latin].
     Mitigation of these in-script and cross-script variants can be addressed by using the Common LGR. 
     For details, see Section 3, “Use of Multiple Reference LGRs in the Same Zone” in [Level-2-Overview].
     In addition to variants defined by this LGR, the full variant information related to this script and added by concurrent use with the Armenian, Cyrillic, and Greek LGR(s) can be found 
     in the following LGR: [Ref-LGR-Latin-Full-Variant-Script]
    </p>
    
    <p>In particular, the Latin LGR contains a number of in-script variants resulting from transitivity with
    variants needed if the LGR is used concurrently with other LGRs from the related scripts, primarily
    due to variants with the Greek script. 
    These variant definitions are required when using this LGR together with the Common LGR in label processing, 
    but they also reflect a certain consistency in the approach to variants across typographically related scripts.
    They can be removed if the LGR is used strictly as standalone.<p>

    <p>All other in-script variants defined in this LGR largely follow the methodology defined in
    Section 6, “Variants”, in [Proposal-Latin]. In a separate appendix  that proposal identifies additional 
    candidates for visually confusable code points (see [Proposal-Latin-Appendices]). They provide data 
    on the basis of which additional variants, or fallback variants (see following) might be defined. However, 
    doing so would require additional review and analysis that has not been carried out for this version of the 
    LGR.</p>

    <p>The LGR defines certain allocatable fallback variants as
    described in Section 4.5.5 “Allocatable Fallback Variants” in [Level-2-Overview]. A fallback variant is a variant label that uses 
    substitute code points for code points or sequences not available (or not allowed) in some contexts, that would 
    otherwise be required for a linguistically accurate rendering of some label.</p>

    <p>When “fallback” variants are defined, two labels may be allocated: a single label with the spelling preferred by the 
    applicant, plus a single fallback variant for that label. 
    The fallback exclusively uses the fallback characters for any characters for which fallbacks are defined, while the
    “preferred” label may use any otherwise valid mix of code points. 
    If the fallback variant is the one applied for, no other variant label is allocatable.</p>

    <p>An allocatable fallback variant exists for the following pairs where the second element of each pair is the fallback:</p>

    <ul>
    
    <h3>In-script Variant Mapping Types</h3>
    <p>In each of the fallback variant pairs defined above, the mapping type from the first element to the second is of type
    “fallback”, while the variant type for the other direction is “blocked”. In addition, the first element of each pair uses the
    reflexive mapping “r-original”.
     (By convention, the prefix “r-” marks a type used in a reflexive variant mapping, that is, it represents an instance 
     of the original code point at that location in a variant label, see Section 5.3.4 in [RFC 7940].)</p>

    <p><b>Variant Disposition:</b> Except for limited exceptions for the fallback variants defined above, variants defined here result
    in a variant label disposition of “blocked”.</p>
    
    <p>The specification of variants in this LGR follows the guidelines in [RFC 8228].</p>

    <h2>Character Classes</h2>
    <p>This LGR does not define named character classes.</p>
    
    <h2>Whole Label Evaluation (WLE) and Context rules</h2>

   <h3>Default Whole Label Evaluation Rules and Actions</h3>

    <p>By default, the LGR includes the rules and actions to implement the following restrictions mandated by the IDNA protocol. They are marked with &#x235F;.</p>
       <ul>
       <li><b>Hyphen Restrictions</b> &mdash; restrictions on the allowable placement of hyphens (no leading/ending hyphen
             and no hyphen in positions 3 and 4). These restrictions are described in Section 4.2.3.1 of RFC 5891 [320]. 
             They are implemented here as context rule on U+002D (-) HYPHEN-MINUS.</li>
          <li><b>Leading Combining Marks</b>   &mdash;  restrictions on the allowable placement of combining marks
             (no leading combining mark). This rule is described in Section 4.2.3.2 of RFC 5891 [320].</li>
       </ul>

    <h3>Latin-specific Rules</h3>

    <h2>Actions</h2>

    <h3>Default Actions</h3>

    <p>This LGR includes the default actions for LGRs as well as the action needed to
        invalidate labels with misplaced combining marks. They are marked with &#x235F;.
        For a description see [RFC 7940].</p>

     <p>Default actions that are
     triggered by the LGR-specific variant types described above limit the “allocatable” variant
     labels to those containing only “ss”, dotted “i” or hyphen variants, while
     disallowing mixed use of “ss” and “ß”, Dotless i and “i”, or middle-dot and hyphen respectively, except
     as in the original applied-for label.</p>

    <p>Note that the mapping types for variants are not symmetric: they depend on which code point is considered
     the source or the target in a given mapping. As specified in [RFC 7940], when mapping types are evaluated
     code points in a label that are unchanged use the type of their “reflexive” mapping. 
     Per [RFC 7940] the actions are always applied one after the other, and the evaluation stops at the first 
     action that assigns a disposition to a given label.</p>
    
    <h3>Script-specific Actions</h3>
    <p>An action has been defined to invalidate labels containing the sequence U+00B7 U+006C U+00B7 which could otherwise result in two Ela Geminada sequences overlapping.</p>

    <h2>Methodology and Contributors</h2>
    
    <p>The LGR in this document has been adapted from the corresponding Reference LGR for the Second Level. The Second Level Reference LGR for the Latin Script was developed by Michel Suignard and Asmus Freytag, based on the Root Zone LGR for the Latin 
       script and information contained or referenced therein; see [RZ-LGR-Latn]. Suitable extensions for the second level have been applied according to the [Guidelines] and with community input. 
       The original proposal for a Root Zone LGR for the Latin script, that this LGR is based on, was developed by the Latin Generation Panel. 
       For more information on methodology and contributors to the underlying Root Zone LGR, see Sections 4 and 8 in [Proposal-Latin], as well as [RZ-LGR-Overview].</p>

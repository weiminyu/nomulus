/**
 * Functionally-static loading cache that keeps track of deletion (AKA drop) times for domains.
 *
 * <p>Some domain names may have many create requests issued shortly before (and directly after) the
 * name is released due to a previous registrant deleting it. In those cases, caching the deletion
 * time of the existing domain allows us to short-circuit the request and avoid any load on the
 * database checking the existing domain (at least, in cases where the request hits a particular
 * node more than once).
 *
 * <p>The cache is fairly short-lived (as we're concerned about many requests at basically the same
 * time), and entries also expire when the drop actually happens. If the domain is re-created after
 * a drop, the next load attempt will populate the cache with a deletion time of END_OF_TIME, which
 * will be read from the cache by subsequent attempts.
 *
 * <p>We take advantage of the fact that Caffeine caches don't store nulls returned from the
 * CacheLoader, so a null result (meaning the domain doesn't exist) won't affect future calls (this
 * avoids a stale-cache situation where the cache "thinks" the domain doesn't exist, but it does).
 * Put another way, if a domain really doesn't exist, we'll re-attempt the database load every time.
 *
 * <p>We don't explicitly set the cache inside domain create/delete flows, in case the transaction
 * fails at commit time. It's better to have stale data, or to require an additional database load,
 * than to have incorrect data.
 *
 * <p>Note: this should be injected as a singleton -- it's essentially static, but we have it as a
 * non-static object for concurrent testing purposes.
